## Description

This project shows users a square canvas, its colours separated in the middle, with yellow on the left side and blue on the right side.

There are two lines of text in the middle of the canvas, formatted with white fill and black border, writing a Jenga-inspired message: "Patience is key - Don't lose your balance!"
